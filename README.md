**Assignment-1**

Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off location. Perform following tasks:

1. Pre-process the dataset.
2. Identify outliers.
3. Check the correlation.
4. Implement linear regression and random forest regression models.
5. Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

**Assignment-2**

Classify the email using the binary classification method. Email Spam detection has two states: a) Normal State – Not Spam, b) Abnormal State – Spam.
Use K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine for classification. Analyze their performance.

**Assignment-3**

Implement Gradient Descent Algorithm to find the local minima of a function. For example, find the local minima of the function y=(x+3)² starting from the point x=2.

**Assignment-4**

Implement K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on diabetes.csv dataset. Compute confusion matrix, accuracy, error rate, precision and recall on the given dataset.
